                    Moving into your school's dormitories is an exciting opportunity to let your personality shine. But
                    there are also some ground rules for decorating a dorm room. "You're not going to completely take
                    away the fact that it's a dorm room," says Amie Freling of interior design brand Meme Hill Studio.
                    Freling has firsthand experience brightening up student housing, including her daughter's cozy
                    freshman dorm room. She says the key to successful dorm room decor is planning ahead. Residence
                    halls offer a ton of information prior to move-in (some even have virtual tours) and knowing the
                    layout and rules will prevent disappointment and wasted time and money down the road. Learn how to
                    transform a utilitarian dorm into a personalized home-away-from-home with these dorm room decorating
                    ideas.

                <h2>1. Define your entryway.</h2>
                <p>
                    As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, staying safe and healthy on college campuses will be important
                    this fall, and setting up your entryway with a few essentials can help stop germs at the door.
                    Although space is likely limited, you can turn even a sliver of wall space into a designated
                    entryway. Mount a few hooks where you can hang up your face mask or ditch a jacket on your way in
                    the door. Many dorm rooms don't include a private bathroom or sink where you can wash up, so station
                    hand sanitizer near the door so you can clean your hands when you return from class. If you have
                    room, hang a small mirror on the wall next to the door or lay down a doormat for an extra homey
                    touch.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Plan ahead:</strong> Most residence halls have restrictions about putting holes in the
                    walls, so opt for
                    self-adhesive, damage-free hooks that don't require tools or nails to hang.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Choose one item to inspire the room.</h2>
                <p>
                    When decorating a dorm room, Freling suggests starting with the bedding or an area rug, as those two
                    spots are prime visual real estate. Whether it's a beloved comforter making the journey to school or
                    a brand-new rug, one focal point item will help kickstart decorating. Opt for a low-pile rug that
                    camouflages dirt and wear and is easy to spot clean. Bedding should also be low maintenance.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Plan ahead:</strong> Furniture and floor dimensions will help you determine what size rug to
                    purchase. An indoor-outdoor rug is an easy-care option but might not be as comfortable on hard tile,
                    so consider your dorm's flooring material, too.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>3. Focus on the bed.</h2>
                <p>
                    Between doing homework, hanging out, and sleeping, students spend a lot of time in bed. A twin
                    upholstered headboard adds cozy style while providing back support for studying and watching TV.
                    Freling used zip ties to attach a headboard to her daughter's metal dorm bed frame. An oversized
                    backrest pillow can do the same thing with the benefit of easily relocating to the floor, a futon,
                    or a study session in another room. Students need good sleep, so quality bedding is also a must. "A
                    good night's sleep makes for a happy student!" says Freling. In addition to looking good, a favorite
                    cozy throw or pillow can bring comfort and joy into this new environment, bolstering student
                    wellbeing.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Plan ahead:</strong> Most, but not all, residence hall mattresses are twin XL. While a
                    regular twin comforter from home might work, new sheets will be needed.
