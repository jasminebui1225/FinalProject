                    Bathroom wall decor can enhance your shower and toilet space. When you cover your bathroom walls
                    with artwork, you create an added layer of style. One shouldn not neglect their bathroom space, and
                    instead, use it as an opportunity to create a modern atmosphere.

                    If you are thinking about redesigning your bathroom, we can help. Here, we will show different
                    bathroom

                <h2>Empty Picture Frames </h2>
                <p>
                    There is not a rule that says you have to include photos inside picture frames. Often, a frame by
                    itself makes a bigger statement. Your bathroom space is the ideal area to pull something like this
                    off.

                    Unlike your living room, bedroom, or dining room, the bathroom is entirely unique. Painted artwork
                    usually is not hung on bathroom walls because the spaces are high-traffic areas and attract
                    moisture.

                    each item was carefully selected. Notice the wood toilet paper ring next to the toilet. When you use
                    pieces that match, make sure each one is unique but also connected to everything else.

                    The multiple-mirror style is a modern approach to bathroom wall decor. The style concept is also an
                    affordable way to turn your bathroom space into an interesting environment. If you wanted to make
                    the effort to impress your friends, this example would do the trick.

                    With bathroom wall decor, anything goes. You can choose a theme to follow, or you can crazy and hang
                    whatever you want on your bathroom walls. It is a bathroom, not a living room, so it is doubtful
                    anyone would complain.

                <h2>Framed Posters</h2>
                <p>
                    This bathroom features a framed poster of the French opera “Miss Dollar” from 1893. When you choose
                    an old entertainment poster, it adds a level of style to your bathroom. The poster is protected with
                    a glass frame that is sealed which protects it from moisture.

                    If you want to breathe some life into your boring bathroom space, find a poster of your favorite
                    movie, frame it, and hang it in your bathroom. It will have an immediate impact on the space.

                <h2>Black And White Photography</h2>
                <p>
                    Framed black and white photography is the most popular wall decor for bathroom walls. For example,
                    pick a theme and display things that are related to it. It could be a collection of animal posters
                    or flowers or anything else you like. Nature seems like a great theme but there are also plenty of
                    other options.
