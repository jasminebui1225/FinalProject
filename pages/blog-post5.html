                    Not everyone would jump at the occasion to move into a tiny home but before you dismiss the idea we
                    suggest you have a look at this amazing project completed by architect Jack Chen of Tsai Design. He
                    purchased the micro apartment which is located in a 1970s building in Melbourne with the intention
                    of turning it into his own perfect home.
                </p>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    The apartment measures only 376 square feet which is around 35 square meters and its original layout
                    was not great, featuring a rather awkward floor plan and a non-functional small kitchen that only
                    had a sink. The transformation was amazing, bringing all sorts of wonderful features and
                    improvements and proving that in order to decorate a small apartment first you need to figure out
                    what the priorities are.
                </p>

            <div class="blog-post-data">
                <img src="../img/post/post5_b.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <img src="../img/post/post5_c.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <img src="../img/post/post5_d.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <img src="../img/post/post5_e.jpg" alt="">

            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    In this case the main goal was to make the tiny apartment feel bigger than it actually is by using a
                    lot of layering and overlapping of functions as well as a simple material palette and a breezy set
                    of colors and finishes. Finding the right furniture for a small space can be a real challenge so
                    here the solution was to build a large floor-to-ceiling wall unit out of wood, sort of like a timber
                    box which stretches between the entryway and the bathroom and which offers plenty of storage for
                    everything.

            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    Other clever storage ideas include the hanging bike rack and the fold-down dining table. The success
                    of this project has a lot to do with the concept of multifunctional spaces. The transition between 2
                    functions is effortless, making living in a tiny apartment not only practical but also enjoyable.
